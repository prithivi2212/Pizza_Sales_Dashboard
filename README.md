# Pizza_Sales_Dashboard
I completed a comprehensive Power BI and SQL data analyst project focused on pizza sales data. The project involved importing CSV data into SQL Server, ensuring accurate data type mappings, and executing queries for total revenue and percentage sales by pizza category and size. I identified the top 5 best-selling pizzas by revenue and configured Power BI for MS SQL Server integration, creating detailed dashboards with KPIs, line charts, and donut charts. I also used Power Query for data cleaning and designed visually appealing, actionable dashboards to provide insights into sales trends, aiding strategic business and inventory decisions
